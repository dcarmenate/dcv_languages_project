<h2><em> Rust</em> </h2>
<p>  Rust “ is an empowering programming language empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software”(first source). 
    Rust was created by Graydon Hoare while he was working for Mozilla, the open-source company. He created the language in hopes that he could write small but 
    fast code without memory bugs and released it to the public in 2010.
     Companies like Microsoft and Amazon regard it as a key to future coding. Rust is memory efficient and can perform critical services and run on embedded devices. </p>

     <h3> What makes Rust special?</h3>
     <ul> 
        <li> Concurrency- Built a support concurrent through its programming system that enforces strict 
           rules for data accessin.</li>
        <li> No garbage collector- Rust does not employ garbage collection.</li>
        <li>Type of inference- Rust compiler automatically detects an expression based on context
            while you code. </li>
     </ul>
