    <h2><em> Ruby</em> </h2>
    <p>Ruby was created by  Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto in 1993. Yukihiro created the language by combining his favorite languages,(Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, java, and Lisp).
        His goal was to create a natural but not simple, way that would mirror “life”. Ruby is a general-purpose programming language and it's one of the most popular web development languages. 
        It is used as a static site generator as it's easy to deploy and is used by tech startups. Ruby also supports object-oriented and functional programming. 
       Companies like Netflix and Hulu use Ruby on rails to facilitate the quick development of web applications.

    <strong> Ruby like Java </strong>
    <ol> Has a garbage collector for memory management </ol>
    <ol> Has strongly “typed” objects </ol>
    <ol> Is an (Object Oriented) language </ol>
    <ol> Austin was here :) It is an interpreted language </ol>
    <br>
    <strong> Unlike Java</strong>
    <ol> The code does not need to be compiled </ol>
    <ol>  Methods cannot be overloaded</ol>
    <ol>  There is no type declaration</ol>
