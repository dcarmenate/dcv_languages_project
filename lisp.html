<h2> "What is Lisp"</h2>
<p> Lisp is a computer programming language developed in 1960 by John McCarthy at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology ). 
    The programming language developed on the theory of recursive functions. A lisp is applied to data rather than being a sequence of procedural steps. 
    Over time lisp became a common language for AI ( artificial intelligence). One example of how Lisp can be used is downloading stock market data and trading.
    Companies such as Grammarly use Lisp to generate recommendations and analyze text, and Boeing which uses a server written in the Lisp variant. 
    Lisp Clojure or ClojureScript users include Amazon, Capital One, and Walmart.
